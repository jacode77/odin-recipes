      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Start by marinating your chicken. In a bowl, add the sliced chicken, 3
          tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon cornstarch,
          and 1 Â½ teaspoons vegetable oil. Rub the marinade ingredients into the
          chicken with your hands until all the liquid has been absorbed by the
          chicken. Set aside for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, prepare the sauce mixture. In a small bowl or measuring cup, add
          the warm chicken stock, sugar, soy sauce, dark soy sauce , oyster
          sauce, sesame oil and white pepper. Stir everything together until
          well combined and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boil water in your wok and blanch the broccoli for 1 minute (or 2
          minutes if you like your broccoli softer). Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clean and dry your wok. Place it over high heat until smoking. Add 2
          tablespoons vegetable oil and sear the chicken until opaque on all
          sides (this should only take about 3 minutes). Turn off the heat,
          remove the chicken, and set aside. The chicken will be about 90% done,
          but will be cooked again at the end.
        </li>
        <li>
          Without washing the wok, set the flame to medium heat. Add another
          tablespoon of oil, along with the garlic and ginger (if using). Stir
          the garlic and ginger for 5 seconds and add the Shaoxing wine around
          the perimeter of the wok. Then pour in the sauce mixture. Use your wok
          spatula to stir the sauce around the sides of the wok to deglaze, and
          let it come to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir up the cornstarch and water slurry and drizzle the mixture into
          sauce while stirring constantly. Allow the sauce to simmer for 10 to
          15 seconds until thick and gravy-like.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toss in the chicken and its juices and the blanched broccoli. Stir-fry
          until the chicken and broccoli is coated in the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          At this point, you can make adjustments. If you like your brown sauce
          darker, add a dash more of dark soy sauce. Add more cornstarch slurry
          if your sauce is too thin, or more chicken stock or water if the sauce
          is too thick. Serve with steamed rice.
        </li>
